Yes, in a well-structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the DAO (Data Access Object) class is responsible for handling the connection to the database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The DAO abstracts the details of accessing data from a database or another persistence mechanism, providing a simple interface for the rest of the application to use.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the roles and interactions within an MVC architecture, particularly focusing on the servlet's interaction with DAO and service classes:

DAO Role
Database Connection: The DAO manages the connection to the database. This includes establishing connections, executing queries, and closing connections.
CRUD Operations: The DAO provides methods for performing CRUD operations on the data. These methods abstract the specifics of how the data is stored and retrieved, allowing the rest of the application to interact with the data without needing to know the details of the database schema or query syntax.
Transaction Management: Depending on the complexity of the operations, the DAO may also handle transaction management, ensuring that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or rolled back in case of failure.
Service Layer Role
Business Logic: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It uses the DAO to interact with the database but focuses on applying business rules and workflows to the data.
Data Transformation: The service layer may transform data between the formats used by the DAO and the models used by the rest of the application. This could involve converting raw database records into domain objects or aggregating data from multiple sources.
Validation: The service layer often performs validation on input data before passing it to the DAO for persistence. This ensures that the data conforms to business rules before it is stored.
Servlet Role
HTTP Request Handling: The servlet acts as the entry point for handling HTTP requests. It parses the request parameters and decides which business operation to perform based on the request URI and method.
Service Invocation: The servlet creates instances of service classes and invokes their methods to perform the requested operation. This involves passing any necessary data to the service methods and handling the results.
View Selection: After the service layer has performed its operations, the servlet selects an appropriate view (such as a JSP page) to render the response. It may prepare data for the view by transforming it into a format suitable for display.
Example Flow
User Action: A user action triggers an HTTP request, such as submitting a form or clicking a link.
Servlet Handling: The servlet receives the request and identifies the operation to perform.
Service Invocation: The servlet creates a service object and calls its method to perform the operation. The service object may use a DAO to interact with the database.
Result Preparation: The servlet prepares the data for the view, possibly transforming it from the format returned by the service layer.
Response Rendering: The servlet selects a view and forwards the request and prepared data to the view for rendering.
Summary
In an MVC architecture, the servlet acts as the controller, coordinating between the view and the model (which includes the service and DAO layers). The DAO handles database connectivity and CRUD operations, while the service layer applies business logic to the data. Together, they enable the servlet to respond to user actions by performing the necessary operations and presenting the results in a user-friendly manner.
